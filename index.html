                    <h2>Plot:</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        "In a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles, the last race of the Piston Cup championship ends in a three-way tie between
                        retiring veteran Strip "The King" Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie Lightning
                        McQueen. The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway
                        in California. Lightning is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first
                        rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-eze
                        and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to
                        start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night
                        long. While McQueen is sleeping, the exhausted Mack drifts off and is startled by a gang of four
                        reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen
                        wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, only to end up in the run-down
                        desert town of Radiator Springs, while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road. After
                        being arrested and impounded overnight (while guarded by a rusty, but friendly, tow truck named Mater),
                        McQueen is ordered by the town judge, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately. The local lawyer Sally
                        Carrera requests that McQueen should instead be given community service to repave the road, to which
                        Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave it in a single day, but it turns out to be shoddy,
                        and he is forced to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time,
                        he befriends several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover
                        along the old U.S. Route 66, but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing it, the town literally
                        vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is really the "Fabulous Hudson Hornet", a
                        three-time Piston Cup winner, whose racing career ended after an accident in 1954, and quickly forgotten
                        by the sport. McQueen finishes the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and
                        spends an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on
                        the town, led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to
                        California in time for the race, while Sally chastises Doc after discovering that he had tipped off
                        the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead. At Los Angeles
                        International Speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully set on the race, and he soon falls into last
                        place. He is surprised to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has
                        taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the
                        pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to
                        lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks—refusing to come behind Weathers
                        again—side swipes Weathers and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this
                        and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and
                        drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but
                        are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal,
                        McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rust-eze as an appreciation of their past support. Later,
                        back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters
                        there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map." (Source: Wikipedia.)
